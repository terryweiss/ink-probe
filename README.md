Part of the **ink** tool suite

This is a nifty little tool that allows you to query objects and arrays using a reach-in syntax and query language based on Mongo's. Some
intended actions the tool was meant to support:

	  var probe = require("ink-probe");
      /*
      for an object or array that contains records with a field that looks like {name: {first: "string", last: "string"}}
      you can query it like os
      */
      var arr = probe.find(objectOrArray, {"name.first": "Terry", "name.last": "Flinstone"});

Now arr contains all of the records in objectOrArray that match the query - records with both a first and last name that match
"Terry" and "Flinstone".

      /* to update records */
      probe.update(objectOrArray, {"name.first": "Terry", "name.last": "Flinstone"}, {$set: {"name.first": "Fred"}});

Now all records that match "Terry Flinstone" will have been updated to "Fred Flinstone".

But wait! Put your checkbook away! You can also `findOne`, `findKeys` and check for `all` and `some` conditions and a ton of other
galaxy conquering goodness. Finally, you can also reach in directly using `get` and force an update directly on a field for a
single record using `set`. How? Good question. See the...

## Installation ##

	npm install ink-probe

## Usage ##
From node:
	var probe = require("ink-probe");

On the web:
Copy `dist/ink.probe.js` or `dist/ink.probe.min.js` to your assets directory and then load it directly

	<script src="js/ink.probe.js"></script>
	<script>
		// all of the methods hang right off of window.ink.probe
        var myValue = ink.probe.find(obj, {field: "value");
	</script>


## Contributing ##

Make sure you have [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) installed globally. To test, you will also need
[nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit) installed globally. To test:

## Roadmap ##
* Translate from coffee to JS.
* Support the `.$.` positional operator for array updates
* Support indexing
* Improve performance for non-indexed operations
